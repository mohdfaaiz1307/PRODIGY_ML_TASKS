# Machine Learning Internship Projects - Prodigy Infotech<br>
## Overview<br>
This repository contains the machine learning projects I developed during my internship at Prodigy Infotech. The internship was aimed at enhancing practical understanding of machine learning and deep learning concepts through real-world tasks. Each project highlights the application of various algorithms and models to solve specific problems. Below are the details of the tasks and their implementations.

## Projects<br>
### 1. House Price Prediction using Linear Regression<br>
Objective: Predict house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.<br>
Techniques: Linear regression, feature scaling, data visualization.<br>
Dataset: Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques.<br>
Key Steps:<br>
Data preprocessing and exploration.<br>
Implementing linear regression.<br>
Evaluating model performance with Cross Validation.<br>
<br>
### 2. Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering<br>
Objective: Segment retail store customers based on their purchase history to identify customer groups for targeted marketing.<br>
Techniques: K-means clustering, data normalization, elbow method.<br>
Dataset: Kaggle Mall_Customers.<br>
Key Steps:<br>
Data preprocessing and normalization.<br>
Applying K-means clustering and identifying optimal number of clusters.<br>
Visualizing customer segments with clustering plots.<br>
<br>
### 3. Cat vs. Dog Image Classification using CNN<br>
Objective: Classify images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).<br>
Techniques: CNN, image preprocessing<br>
Dataset: Kaggle dogs vs cats.<br>
Key Steps:<br>
Data preprocessing and augmentation.<br>
Building a CNN model with layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dense.<br>
Evaluating model accuracy on test data.<br>
Note: Originally tasked with implementing SVM, this project was adapted using CNN for improved image classification performance.<br>
<br>
### 4. Hand Gesture Recognition for Volume Control<br>
Objective: Develop a hand gesture recognition system that can detect and classify hand gestures for controlling volume.<br>
Techniques: OpenCV for image/video processing, data collection and annotation.<br>
Key Steps:<br>
Creating a hand gesture recognition model using OpenCV for real-time video feed.<br>
Implementing volume control based on recognized gestures.<br>
<br>
### 5. Food Item Recognition and Calorie Estimation<br>
Objective: Build a model to recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content.<br>
