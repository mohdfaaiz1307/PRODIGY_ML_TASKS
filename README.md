Machine Learning Internship Projects - Prodigy Infotech<br>
Overview<br>
This repository contains the machine learning projects I developed during my internship at Prodigy Infotech. The internship was aimed at enhancing practical understanding of machine learning and deep learning concepts through real-world tasks. Each project highlights the application of various algorithms and models to solve specific problems. Below are the details of the tasks and their implementations.

Projects<br>
1. House Price Prediction using Linear Regression<br>
Objective: Predict house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.<br>
Techniques: Linear regression, feature scaling, data visualization.<br>
Dataset: House price dataset (synthetic or sourced from a real estate dataset).<br>
Key Steps:<br>
Data preprocessing and exploration.<br>
Implementing linear regression.<br>
Evaluating model performance with RMSE and RÂ² scores.<br>

2. Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Objective: Segment retail store customers based on their purchase history to identify customer groups for targeted marketing.
Techniques: K-means clustering, data normalization, elbow method.
Dataset: Retail purchase history dataset (synthetic or sourced from a retail dataset).
Key Steps:
Data preprocessing and normalization.
Applying K-means clustering and identifying optimal number of clusters.
Visualizing customer segments with clustering plots.

3. Cat vs. Dog Image Classification using CNN
Objective: Classify images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
Techniques: CNN, image preprocessing, data augmentation.
Dataset: Kaggle Cat vs. Dog Dataset.
Key Steps:
Data preprocessing and augmentation.
Building a CNN model with layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dense.
Evaluating model accuracy on test data.
Note: Originally tasked with implementing SVM, this project was adapted using CNN for improved image classification performance.


4. Hand Gesture Recognition for Volume Control
Objective: Develop a hand gesture recognition system that can detect and classify hand gestures for controlling volume.
Techniques: CNN, OpenCV for image/video processing, data collection and annotation.
Dataset: Custom dataset of hand gestures.
Key Steps:
Creating a hand gesture recognition model using CNN.
Integrating with OpenCV for real-time video feed.
Implementing volume control based on recognized gestures.

5. Food Item Recognition and Calorie Estimation
Objective: Build a model to recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content.
Techniques: CNN, image classification, data augmentation.
Dataset: Custom food images dataset.
Key Steps:
Data preprocessing and augmentation for food images.
Building a CNN model to classify different food items.
Estimating calorie content based on the recognized food item.
